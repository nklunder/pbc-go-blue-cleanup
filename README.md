# PBC & LW Campaign Page CSS Update

All pages make use of a common set of style rules. The only divergence is in the background color of the `.banner` class. Each LOB has an extension class (`.banner-lifewise`, `.banner-premera`) that apply the color.

In the html for all LOBs, the new unordered lists use a placeholder class of `icon-radio-checked2` that will need to be replaced with `icon-checkmark-circle2` when put into production.
